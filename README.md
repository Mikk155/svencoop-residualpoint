# Residual-Point-svencoop

## This is a port of the Half-Life mod "Residual Point" for Sven Co-op.

### This project is abandoned and was once deleted as i didn't care a shit about it.

### But since i've found a copy of the repository on my local machine and it is fun to play in hardcore so i'll leave this here as the scmapdb's version is outdated asf and sucks ass.

### I ain't touching this unless i really want to fix something for kale's server. Though you are completely free to fork this repository, modify and do a pull request, i will be actively accepting.
